WebRTC Example - RTCDataChannel
==============
## Instructions for integrating with heroku

NOTE: I removed https support and made other changes to make this work. Useful resources: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs, https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets.
- make heroku account and download CLI
- go to project folder and do npm install etc.  
- run `heroku create`
- then run `heroku local web` to test on local machine
- deploy using `git push heroku main` (after any commits)

Currently running on https://serene-fortress-62530.herokuapp.com/, allows two different people to chat. Note that server goes to sleep after lack of activity, so it might be slower to load. You can see a log of the server activity by running `heroku logs --tail` in the project directory.


This is a fork of Shane Tully's (shanetully.com)  original 'as simple as it gets' WebRTC Example.  
https://github.com/shanet/WebRTC-Example

As the name suggests, the aim of this fork is to use an RTCDataChannel instead of the normal media track.

The RTCDataChannel specific code is based on Mozilla's RTCDataChannel sample:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Simple_RTCDataChannel_sample

Note that as per the original repo, this project uses a Websocket as the signalling server.  
The node.js server sets up a Websocket, and each 'client' connects to it with a unique UUID.  
The server then broadcasts out every message that it receives, and the clients then decide what to do with each message
(and ignore it if it actually originally came from them!)

The following instructions are a slightly modified version of those (still relevant) in the main repo:

## Usage

The signaling server uses Node.js, `express` and `ws` and can be started as such:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

With the server running, open two windows of a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari and visit `https://localhost:8443`.

* Note the HTTPS! There is no redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
* Some browsers or OSs may not allow the webcam to be used by multiple pages at once. You may need to use two different browsers or machines.

## TLS

Recent versions of Chrome require secure websockets for WebRTC. Thus, this example utilizes HTTPS. Included is a self-signed certificate that must be accepted in the browser for the example to work.

## Problems?

WebRTC is a rapidly evolving beast. Being an example that I don't check often, I rely on users for reports if something breaks. Issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.
